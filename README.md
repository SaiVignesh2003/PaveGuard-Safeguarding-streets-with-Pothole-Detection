# PaveGuard-Safeguarding-streets-with-Pothole-Detection
Potholes are a prevalent problem on roadways, causing damage to vehicles and posing risks to road safety. Detecting and addressing these road defects in a timely manner is crucial. This project aims to develop a real-time pothole detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection.
